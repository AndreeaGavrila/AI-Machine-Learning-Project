# AI-Machine-Learning-Project

**Project Name:**   _Monochrome Dreams Classification_

**General Info:** 

**Project achievements:**
- Classify monochrome images dreamed by deep generative models

Project description and main objectives:
- It using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train a model for monochrome image classification. This is a multi-way classification task in which an image must be classified into one of the nine classes.

- The training data is composed of 30,000 image files. The validation set is composed of 5,000 image files. The test is composed of 5,000 image files.
